# Basketball League DB

A .NET 8.0 WPF desktop application for managing a recreational basketball league. Users can browse leagues, seasons, teams, rosters, games, and per-game player statistics through a dark-themed UI backed by a SQL Server database.

> **No ORM frameworks were used.** All database interaction is performed via raw SQL stored procedures using `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`.

## Database Setup

### Requirements
- SQL Server LocalDB (`(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`) — installed with Visual Studio

### Option A — Batch script (easiest)
```
cd BasketballDB\Scripts
RunSetup.bat
```

### Option B — Manual (SSMS or sqlcmd)
1. Run `Scripts/Setup.sql` — creates the `BasketballLeague560` database, schema, tables, and all stored procedures.
2. Run `Scripts/Populate.sql` — seeds locations, leagues, seasons, teams, players, games, and player game stats.

The database and all objects are created idempotently — safe to re-run.

---

## Running the Application

1. Complete the database setup above.
2. Open `BasketballDB.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Set `Frontend` as the startup project.
4. Press **F5**.

**Default login:** `admin` / `admin`
